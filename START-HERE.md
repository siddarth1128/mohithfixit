## 🎯 FASTEST FIX (Do This First!)

### Step 1: Start Your Servers (2 minutes)

**Windows:** Double-click this file:
```
start-servers.bat
```

**Mac/Linux:** Run in terminal:
```bash
chmod +x start-servers.sh
./start-servers.sh
```

**OR Start Manually:**
```bash
# Open Terminal/CMD Window 1:
cd backend
npm install
npm start

# Open Terminal/CMD Window 2 (NEW WINDOW):
npm install  
npm start
```

### Step 2: Run the Automated Test (1 minute)

**Open this file in your web browser:**
```
tests/test-connections.html
```

The test will:
- ✅ Check if servers are running
- ✅ Test all connections
- ✅ Diagnose your exact problem
- ✅ Tell you how to fix it

### Step 3: Follow the Instructions

The test page will show:
- 🟢 **Green (✓)** = Working correctly
- 🔴 **Red (✗)** = Needs fixing (with instructions!)
- 🟡 **Yellow (⚠)** = Warning (usually okay)

### Step 4: Try Logging In Again!

## 🔍 Quick Diagnosis

### "Both Servers Offline" 🚨

**You'll See:** Red errors saying servers aren't running

**Fix:**
```bash
# Terminal 1
cd backend && npm start

# Terminal 2
npm start
```

### "Can't Login as User" 🔴

**You'll See:** User login fails, but maybe provider works

**Fix:**
```bash
# Start backend server
cd backend
npm start

# Start MongoDB
# Windows: net start MongoDB
# Mac: brew services start mongodb-community
# Linux: sudo systemctl start mongod
```

### "Can't Login as Provider" 🔴

**You'll See:** Provider login fails

**Fix:**
```bash
# Start root server
npm start
```

### "Port 9000 Not Found" ⚠️

**You'll See:** Browser console error about localhost:9000

**Fix:** Use the correct files:
- ✅ Use `public/book_service.html` (not the root one)
- ✅ Use `user_login.html` for customers
- ❌ Avoid `service/provider_*.html` (they expect port 9000)

## 🆘 Still Stuck?

### Check These Common Issues:

**Dependencies Not Installed?**
```bash
npm install
cd backend && npm install
```

**MongoDB Not Running? (needed for user login)**
```bash
# Windows
net start MongoDB

# Mac
brew services start mongodb-community

# Linux
sudo systemctl start mongod
```

**Ports Already in Use?**
```bash
# Windows
netstat -ano | findstr "4000 6000"
taskkill /PID <PID> /F

# Mac/Linux
lsof -ti:4000 | xargs kill -9
lsof -ti:6000 | xargs kill -9
```

### Nuclear Option (Reset Everything):
```bash
# 1. Stop all servers (Ctrl+C)
# 2. Delete and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules backend/node_modules
npm install
cd backend && npm install
# 3. Restart servers
```

## 📊 Understanding Your Setup

### Two Servers Run Simultaneously:

**Port 4000 - Root Server**
- Provider registration/login
- Booking system
- Provider services
- Uses in-memory storage

**Port 6000 - Backend Server**
- User registration/login
- JWT authentication
- Password reset
- **Requires MongoDB**

### Which Login Page to Use:

**For Customers/Users:**
- File: `user_login.html`
- Connects to: Port 6000
- Needs: Backend Server + MongoDB
- Register at: `user_register.html`

**For Service Providers:**
- Currently broken (expects Port 9000)
- Fix: Update files to use Port 4000
- OR: Use root server APIs directly

## 🚀 Quick Command Reference

### Start Everything:
```bash
# Option 1: Use the script
./start-servers.sh  # Mac/Linux
start-servers.bat   # Windows

# Option 2: Manual
Terminal 1: cd backend && npm start
Terminal 2: npm start
```

### Run Tests:
```bash
# Visual (recommended)
Open: tests/test-connections.html

# Command line
node tests/test-connections.js
```

### Check Status:

http://localhost:4000
http://localhost:6000

# Should see JSON, not errors
```

## 🎉 What's Next?

### Once Tests Pass:

1. **Create accounts** - Register users and providers
2. **Test features** - Try booking a service
3. **Fix warnings** - Address any yellow warnings
4. **Deploy** - When ready for production

### If Tests Fail:

1. **Read error messages** - They tell you what to fix
2. **Follow instructions** - The test provides steps
3. **Run tests again** - Verify fixes worked
4. **Repeat** - Until all green!

## 💡 Pro Tips

- Keep both terminal windows visible to see errors
- Run tests after any configuration changes
- Use `public/` folder files (they're configured correctly)
- MongoDB is ONLY needed for user login (Port 6000)
- Provider features work without a database (Port 4000)
